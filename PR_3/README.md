## Practical work #3

## Task 1

Required: 
Create the Book class. Create classes Title, Author and Content, each of which must contain one string field and the void Show() method. 
Implement the ability to add a book title, author name and content to the book. 
The title of the book should be set only once (without the possibility of changing), and the author and content can be edited (properties will help with this).
Using the Show() method, display the book title, author, and table of contents in different colors.

The Point class must contain two integer fields and one string field.

Create a custom constructor, in the body of which initialize the fields with the values of the arguments. 
The Figure class should contain constructors that take from 3 to 5 arguments of type Point. 
Create two methods: double LengthSide(Point A, Point B), which calculates the length of the side of the polygon; void PerimeterCalculator(), which calculates the perimeter of the polygon. 
Write a program that displays the name and perimeter of the polygon.
